# VocPrez-theme-dawe
A VocPrez UI theme for the [Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE)](https://www.awe.gov.au/)

`apply_*.sh` adds HTML templates, style files and config settings to a VocPrez instance.

`apply_dev.sh` configures a dev instance and `apply_vm.sh` is for testing the instance on a VM.

`apply_[dev/vm]_windows.sh` was created and edited in Windows, where `apply_[dev/vm].sh` has return characters removed for use. `apply_[dev/vm].sh` should be used when configuring the VocPrez instance.
